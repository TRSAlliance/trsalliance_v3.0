TRS Alliance v3.0 — Netlify Deployment Guide

1) Connect repository to Netlify (or upload this ZIP as a new site).
2) Settings -> Build & deploy:
   - Branch to deploy: main (or leave blank for ZIP deploy)
   - Build command: npm run build
   - Publish directory: dist
   - Functions directory: netlify/functions (optional)
3) Environment variables (only if using Firebase or external APIs):
   - VITE_API_KEY, VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN, VITE_PROJECT_ID, etc.
4) Deploy site. If you see a blank page on refresh, SPA redirect is already set in netlify.toml.
